Refactoring exercise, taken from the book: Test-Driven Development in Microsoft .NET

From Chapter 3: Sieve of Eratosthenes

The code we will refactor implements an algorithm to generate small prime numbers (say up to 10,000,000). The algorithm is called the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Make a list of all the integers less than or equal to n (and greater than one). Strike out the multiples of all primes less than or equal to the square root of n; the numbers that are left are the primes ( http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=SieveOfEratosthenes ).

Fork this repo, work through refactorings, then submit a pull request. You can work through the refactorings from the book (if you have it) or you can just work your own refactorings.

The tests must continue to pass, although you can refactor those as well!

The refactorings from the book are in the branch: book_refactorings. Use that as a reference if you get stuck.

Enjoy!
